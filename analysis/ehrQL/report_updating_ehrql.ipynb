    "This report accompanies [this report](https://reports.opensafely.org/reports/changes-in-pincer-measures-throughout-the-covid-19-pandemic/) describing practice level changes in adherence to PINCER indicators of prescription and medication monitoring throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. This version includes data from the EHR provider TPP only and will be updated regularly.

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Pharmacist-led information technology intervention (PINCER) is an effective way to reduce errors in prescription and medication monitoring which are responsible for a large proportion of adverse drug events. This is achieved through the monitoring of 13 PINCER indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to describe practice level changes in adherence to each of the PINCER indicators throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. For each indicator, practice level monthly rates of hazardous prescribing are calculated, ranked and used to calculate deciles of activity, which are represented as decile charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 13 PINCER measures include:\n",
    "* [Gastrointestinal (GI) Bleed Indicators](#gi_bleed)\n",
    "    * [Age 65+, on oral NSAID without gastroprotection (GI_P3A)](#a)\n",
